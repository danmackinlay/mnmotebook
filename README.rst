mnmotebook
###########

This is the mnmotebook theme, adapted from `mnmlist theme <http://mnmlist.com/theme>`_ adapted for Pelican from the mnmlist wordpress theme.


Settings
~~~~~~~~

There's one additional setting used by this theme, if present:

::

    HIDE_DATE = False

If ``HIDE_DATE`` is set to ``True``, dates won't be displayed under the blog post titles.


Compass
~~~~~~~

The ``main.css`` file is generated from the ``compass/src/main.scss`` sass file, using http://compass-style.org/

From the command line::

    compass compile

or maybe try `scout <https://mhs.github.io/scout-app/>`_.

Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This theme sorts by "modified" date; if not all your articles have "modifed" dates, you might want to use the "always modified" plugin.
